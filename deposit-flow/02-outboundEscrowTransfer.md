# Function Review: outboundEscrowTransfer(...)

## Function Code

```solidity
function outboundEscrowTransfer(
    address _l1Token,
    address _from,
    uint256 _amount
) internal virtual returns (uint256 amountReceived) {
    // this method is virtual since different subclasses can handle escrow differently
    // user funds are escrowed on the gateway using this function
    uint256 prevBalance = IERC20(_l1Token).balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC20(_l1Token).safeTransferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
    uint256 postBalance = IERC20(_l1Token).balanceOf(address(this));
    return postBalance - prevBalance;
}
```

## Function Explanation

`outboundEscrowTransfer(...)` is the parent-chain escrow step in the deposit flow.

It is usually called inside `outboundTransfer(...)`.

This function is responsible for moving or locking the user's tokens on parent L2 before the bridge creates or finalizes the L2 credit.

At a high level, this function usually:

- receives the token address
- receives the sender address
- receives the requested amount
- transfers tokens from the user to the bridge/escrow
- returns or defines the amount that should be used for downstream accounting

The main security idea is:

```text
The bridge must credit L2 only for the amount that was actually received or escrowed on parent L2.
```

If this function does not correctly handle the token transfer, the entire deposit accounting can become wrong.

---

## Important Logic Notes

### Token Transfer / Escrow

If the function performs a token transfer using something like:

```solidity
transferFrom(...);
```

or:

```solidity
safeTransferFrom(...);
```

this is the core escrow operation.

This is where the bridge should actually receive the user's parent-chain tokens.

If this step fails or behaves unexpectedly, the bridge must not continue as if the deposit succeeded.

---

### Actual Received Amount

The most important point in this function is the difference between `amount` and `actualReceived`.

```text
amount = what the user requested to transfer
actualReceived = what the bridge actually received
```

For standard ERC20 tokens, these values usually match.

For fee-on-transfer tokens, they may differ.

Example:

```text
User sends: 100
Bridge receives: 98
Fee taken by token: 2
```

The safest accounting pattern is:

```text
actualReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore
```

If the bridge later credits L2 using `amount` instead of `actualReceived`, L2 may receive more value than parent-chain escrow actually holds.

---

### Non-Standard Token Behavior

Some tokens do not behave like normal ERC20 tokens.

Examples:

- fee-on-transfer tokens
- false-return tokens
- rebasing tokens
- pausable or blacklistable tokens
- malicious tokens with callbacks/hooks

This matters because the bridge may assume that a token transfer succeeded and moved exactly `amount`, but the real balance change may be different.

---

### Return Value

If the function returns an amount, that returned value is important.

It may be used later for:

- calldata construction
- L2 mint/release amount
- accounting updates

The returned value should represent the real escrowed/received amount, not only the user-requested amount.
