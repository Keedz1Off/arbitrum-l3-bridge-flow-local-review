# Function Review: getOutboundCalldata(...)

## Function Code

```solidity
function getOutboundCalldata(
    address _l1Token,
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _amount,
    bytes memory _data
) public view virtual override returns (bytes memory outboundCalldata) {
    // this function is public so users can query how much calldata will be sent to the L2
    // before execution
    // it is virtual since different gateway subclasses can build this calldata differently
    // ( ie the standard ERC20 gateway queries for a tokens name/symbol/decimals )
    bytes memory emptyBytes = "";

    outboundCalldata = abi.encodeWithSelector(
        ITokenGateway.finalizeInboundTransfer.selector,
        _l1Token,
        _from,
        _to,
        _amount,
        GatewayMessageHandler.encodeToL2GatewayMsg(emptyBytes, _data)
    );

    return outboundCalldata;
}
```

## Function Explanation

`getOutboundCalldata(...)` builds the calldata / payload that will be sent from L2 to L3.

This function usually runs after the bridge has selected the token path and prepared the deposit values.

The main purpose is to encode the values that the child-chain gateway will later decode and use during finalization.

Main idea:

```text
Calldata must represent the real L2 -> L3 deposit.
```

If wrong values are encoded here, the L2 side may execute normally but credit the wrong amount, token, or recipient.

---

## Important Logic Notes

### Encoding Step

If the function uses something like:

```solidity
abi.encode(...);
```

or:

```solidity
abi.encodeWithSelector(...);
```

this is the point where bridge values become message data.

Important values usually include:

- token
- sender
- recipient
- amount
- extra data

The values must be correct before encoding.

---

### Amount in Calldata

The encoded amount should match the amount that is actually backed by parent-chain escrow.

Important distinction:

```text
input amount != always actual received amount
```

If the bridge received less than the user-supplied amount but encodes the original amount, L2 may credit more than L1 holds.

---

### Encode / Decode Match

The format used here must match the format expected by the L2 finalize function.

```text
L1 encode format = L2 decode format
```

If these formats differ, L2 may decode the wrong amount, token, or recipient.
