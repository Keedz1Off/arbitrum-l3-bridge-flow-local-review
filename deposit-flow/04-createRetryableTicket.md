## Function Explanation

`createRetryableTicket(...)` creates the L2 -> L3 retryable ticket.

In the deposit flow, this is the step where prepared calldata is submitted to Arbitrum so it can later execute on L3.

Main idea:

```text
The retryable ticket transports the deposit message from L2 to L3.
```

This function is important because a valid retryable ticket can still be dangerous if it targets the wrong L2 contract or contains wrong calldata.

---

## Important Logic Notes

### L2 Target

The retryable ticket must target the correct child-chain gateway.

```text
wrong L2 target = wrong execution path
```

If the target is wrong, the message may fail or execute unintended logic.

---

### Calldata Passed to L2

The calldata passed into the retryable ticket should already contain verified deposit values.

Important values:

- amount
- token
- recipient
- finalize selector

The ticket should not carry corrupted or user-overridden bridge data.

---

### Gas and Refund Parameters

Retryable tickets depend on execution budget and refund addresses.

Important values may include:

- gas limit
- max fee per gas
- max submission cost
- excess fee refund address
- call value refund address

If these values are unsafe, the deposit may become delayed, fail, or redirect value unexpectedly.
